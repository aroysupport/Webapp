		THE ARTIST AGREES THAT NEITHER PUBLISHER OF MANE PAGE NOR ITS AFFILIATES, NOR
		ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, MEMBERS, OWNERS,
		AGENTS, REPRESENTATIVES, LICENSORS AND (SUB)LICENSEES (OTHER THAN YOURSELF,
		AS APPLICABLE), SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, WHETHER DIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
		INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL, ARISING FROM ANY USE OR NON-USE OF THE CONTENT,
		EVEN IF SUCH PARTIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED, OR ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY, OF SUCH
		DAMAGES.<br>
		THE CONTENT IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS
		AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS
		OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
		MERCHANTABILITY, MERCHANTABLE QUALITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
		PUBLISHER OF MANE PAGE DOES NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE CONTENT
		WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR THAT ITS USE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR
		FREE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CONTENT IS
		WITH YOU. SHOULD THE QUALITY OF SUCH CONTENT BE DEFECTIVE YOU (AND NOT ANY
		OF THE INDEMNITEES) ASSUME THE ENTIRE RISK AND COST OF ALL CORRECTIONS.

		releases from property owners, manufacturers or designers of commercial products such as
		(without limitation) automobiles, aircraft, packaged products, designer clothing, etc. that are
		depicted in some Content as it is generally not possible for any stock image library or artist to
		get blanket releases for such products. The procuring of such releases, which may sometimes
		be obtained on a case-by-case basis, is the responsibility of the ARTIST.<br><br>
		
		8. Limited Warranty<br>
		(a) Subject to the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, including without
		limitation the provisions relating to limitation of liability in this Section 8, ARTIST hereby
		represents and warrants that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 7 above
		(Limitations and Disclaimers), the use by the PUBLISHER OF MANE PAGE of the Content as
		provided and as authorized hereunder shall not infringe or violate the intellectual property
		rights, publicity rights or privacy rights of any third party, and that all necessary model and
		property releases have been properly obtained in respect of such Content.<br>
		(b) Subject to subsections (c), (d) and (e) below, ARTIST agrees to defend, indemnify and hold
		harmless the PUBLISHER OF MANE PAGE from and against all damages, liabilities and
		expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising directly from any actual or threatened
		lawsuit, claim or legal proceeding (collectively, a “Claim”) commenced by a third party against
		the PUBLISHER OF MANE PAGE arising from a breach of the representations and warranties
		set forth in subsection (a) above; conditioned upon and provided that the ARTIST gives
		PUBLISHER OF MANE PAGE (i) prompt written notice of any threatened Claim known to the
		ARTIST or any suit or proceeding actually initiated against the ARTIST, (ii) full information,
		assistance and cooperation for the defense or settlement thereof, and (iii) at PUBLISHER OF

		times in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and that the ARTIST is
		not otherwise in breach of this Agreement.<br>
		(c) PUBLISHER OF MANE PAGE nor any other Indemnitee shall have any liability for, and
		PUBLISHER OF MANE PAGE’s obligations under subsection (b) above shall not apply to: (i) any
		damages, liabilities or expenses incurred by the ARTIST prior to its notification of the Claim to
		PUBLISHER OF MANE PAGE; and/or (ii) any Claim based on or arising out of: (1) the
		modification by the ARTIST of the Content; (2) the combination of the Content with any other
		work(s); and/or (3) the context in which the Content has been used by the ARTIST.<br>
		(d) EXCEPT FOR ANY LIABILITY WHICH CANNOT BY LAW BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED, THE
		INDEMNITEES WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER THIRD PARTY CLAIMING
		THROUGH YOU FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, STATUTORY OR
		CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF, OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT
		AND/OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SITE/APP OR THE CONTENT, WHETHER
		FRAMED AS A BREACH OF WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
		OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, IN TORT, CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE. IN NO
		EVENT WILL THE INDEMNITIES' TOTAL MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU OR ANY
		THIRD PARTY CLAIMING THROUGH YOU ARISING FROM THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OF
		ANY CONTENT LICENSED HEREUNDER, EXCEED TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS ($10,000.00)
		REGARDLESS OF THE NUMBER OR TYPE OF CLAIMS AND REGARDLESS OF THE NUMBER
		OF TIMES THAT YOU LICENSE THE SAME CONTENT FROM PUBLISHER OF MANE PAGE. THE
		FOREGOING EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS ARE APPLICABLE NOTWITHSTANDING ANY
		FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.<br>
		CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, OR
		THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
		DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN SUCH JURISDICTIONS,
		THE LIABILITY OF THE INDEMNITEES WILL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT
		PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br>
		(e) The foregoing states the entire liability and obligation of PUBLISHER OF MANE PAGE and
		the other Indemnitees, and the sole and exclusive remedy of the ARTIST, with respect to any
		breach of the representations and warranties contained in subsection (a) above.<br>
		(f) PUBLISHER OF MANE PAGE is relying on the representations and warranties made by
		Artists regarding the Content and their compliance with PUBLISHER OF MANE PAGE’s Terms
		of Use, including the non-infringement of Content, and PUBLISHER OF MANE PAGE does not
		have the right or ability to control the Content for purposes of the Digital Millennium
		Copyright Act or any claim of liability made by any third party against PUBLISHER OF MANE
		PAGE. PUBLISHER OF MANE PAGE does not act as agent for ARTISTS who license Content or
		ARTISTS who use the Content, and, except as specifically set forth in this Section 8, does not
		guarantee the quality, title, or legality of the Content, or the truth or accuracy of listings
		associated with the Content. Accordingly, except with respect to claims arising from the
		breach by ARTIST of the warranties set forth in subsection (a) above, you hereby irrevocably
		and unconditionally release and waive any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and
		consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, that you may have or assert
		against PUBLISHER OF MANE PAGE relating to or arising out of the purchase of a license to or
		the use of the Content.<br><br>
		
		9. Term and Termination<br>
		This Agreement shall continue in perpetuity unless terminated in accordance with this Section
		9. PUBLISHER OF MANE PAGE at any time may terminate this Agreement with respect to any
		Content in the event of any breach by the ARTIST of any of his or her representations,
		warranties or obligations under this Agreement. The ARTIST may at any time terminate this
		Agreement. Each of PUBLISHER OF MANE PAGE and the ARTIST shall notify the other in the
		event it, he or she terminates this Agreement. PUBLISHER OF MANE PAGE shall also have the
		right, in its sole discretion, to deny the uploading of any Content from the SITE/APP. Upon

		such Content, destroy, or upon the request of PUBLISHER OF MANE PAGE return the Content
		to PUBLISHER OF MANE PAGE, delete or remove the Content and all derivative works and
		related materials (if any), in his or her possession or control and shall ensure that its clients and
		customers do likewise. Termination of this Agreement shall not relieve the ARTIST from any
		payment obligations that may have arisen prior to such termination. Further, the termination of
		this Agreement shall operate without prejudice to PUBLISHER OF MANE PAGE's rights,
		defenses and limitations of liability provided under this Agreement, which rights, defenses
		and limitations of liability shall survive termination of this Agreement.<br><br>
