		Artist Credits:<br>
		Uploads use Artist credits. Two free credits are provided for the tutorial (first upload).<br><br>
		
		Additional Artist credits are available as an in-app purchase in small, medium or large packs:
		small pack of Artist credits (10 credits) costs $0.99<br>
		medium pack of Artist credits (100 credits) costs $3.99…under 5 cents per credit<br>
		large pack of Artist credits (3000 credits)…under 1 cent per credit<br><br>
		
		An Artist credit is a consumable product. Consumable products, by their nature, aren’t synced
		or restored. Please understand that, for example, buying ten credits on an iPhone doesn’t also
		give ten credits on an iPad, and vice versa.<br><br>
		
		Artist Gallery:<br>
		We curate Brand Galleries to select outstanding images to be featured in the Artist Gallery on
		the Mane Page social network for a limited time of 60 days.<br><br>
		
		My Artwork & Brand Galleries:<br>
		Brand Galleries on Mane Page are collections of artwork that portray the artist’s interpretation
		of a brand’s philosophy, lifestyle and image. Brand Galleries are viewable on a secure web site
		that only brand owners can access. Artists can go to Upload Artwork >> My Artwork to view
		their past uploads. Brand owners can view all artwork in their galleries. Copyright for
		uploaded artwork is controlled by the artist and artists keep 100% of the proceeds from
		artwork rights & permissions sold to a brand owner. We do not take a cut. We offer Artist
		credits to cover the cost of hosting the artwork in a Brand Gallery for two years.<br><br>
		
		Digital Piracy Protection:<br>
		Only the brand owners can view artwork in their galleries. Brand Galleries are designed this
		way to help commercial photographers who yearn for greater digital piracy and intellectual
		property protection. Brand Galleries are an alternative to the prevailing contributor platforms
		that typically give away unrestricted online access and even allow free embedding of artists’
		stock photography.Privacy Built In for Artists<br><br>
		
		Mane Page is a social network with privacy built in. Mane Page never asks for personally
		identifiable information like real names and email addresses. So how does the brand owner
		contact the artist to show interest in using their uploaded artwork? Artist’s can tag (# hashtag)
		their uploaded artwork with information that gives the brand owner information about how to
		contact the artist.<br><br>
		
		Workflow:<br>
		Mane Page mobile app has an upload feature. All other aspects of the photographer’s
		workflow (e.g. taking photos, shoot documentation, post-processing editing, releases,
		licensing & copyright, etc.) are always the responsibility of the artist.<br><br>
		
		Releases:<br>
		It is always the responsibility of the artist to have available model releases, property releases,
		witnesses and any other necessary information about a shoot that might be required by the
		brand owner.<br><br>
		
		License Agreement:<br>
		Mane Page can provide a sample license agreement to for artists to use with the brand
		owners. If you would like a copy please write us for more information at
		artist.license@manepage.com<br><br>
		
		Artist-in-Residence Program:<br>
		We will soon offer an exciting Artist-in-Residence Program. If you are interested please write us
		for more information at artist.residence@manepage.com<br><br>
		
		More Help:<br>
